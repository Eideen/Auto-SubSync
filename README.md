#Auto SubSync

Simple batch script for SubSync. Linux only.

Now only works with movies. TV Shows to be add later.

Needs SubSync and ffmpeg installed, otherwise will not work.

Copies subtitles to a separate folder(./subtitles/) to avoid undesired actions. You are free then to use the automation included or to copy manually.

Once processed the subtitle name is put on subtitles.txt file so is ignored the next time is run. You can place a subtitle name on that file if you want to ignore it.
